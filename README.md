# Letterboxd-diary-collage-maker
Script that creates a collage of movies wacthed on a chosen month based on your Letterboxd username. The script does not require your account password, nor access to Letterboxd's API.

When running the script, enter the Letterboxd username, the year and the month as a two character number (e.g. 09 for September).
